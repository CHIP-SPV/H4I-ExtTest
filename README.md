# Overview

This project contains a collection of standalone test programs
that exercise the Hip-for-Intel (H4I) libraries.  This collection
does not obviate the test suites internal to each library's project,
but are intended to demonstrate that client programs can
build, link, and run against the installed library, as opposed
to the internal test suite which uses built but not-yet-installed files.

# Configure, Build, and Install

The project uses CMake for configuration, build, and install.
