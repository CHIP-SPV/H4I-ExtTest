# Overview

This project contains a collection of standalone test programs
that exercise the Hip-for-Intel (H4I) libraries.  This collection
does not obviate the test suites internal to each library's project,
but are intended to provide confidence that client programs can
build, link, and run against the installed library, as opposed
to the internal test suite which uses the not-yet-installed files.
